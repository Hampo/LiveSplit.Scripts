# "Watch_Dogs 2" Load Remover

**How to install:**

1. In the LiveSplit splits editor, make sure your game is set to "Watch_Dogs 2" (without quotes) and then click the "Activate" button.
2. Disable **EasyAntiCheat** for the game; this can be done by adding the `-eac_launcher` command line option. This is needed because it blocks the game's memory from being read. The game should alert you that this has worked on start up; if it doesn't, try restarting your computer and then launching the game again.
    - See [this PCGamingWiki article](http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Command_line_arguments) for how to go about doing this.
3. In LiveSplit, set "Game Time" as your main timing method; right-click the main window > Compare Against > Game Time. (Both real time and time without loads are stored in your splits regardless.)

**Versions supported:**

This load remover *should* work for copies bought from any storefront. Your current version is visible in the main menu and the pause menu. I advise you disable automatic updating of your game if possible, because new versions will not be supported straight away.
