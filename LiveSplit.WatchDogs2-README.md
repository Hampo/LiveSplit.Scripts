# "Watch_Dogs 2" Autosplitter and Load Remover

## How to install

1. In the LiveSplit splits editor, make sure your game is set to "Watch_Dogs 2" (without quotes) and then click the "Activate" button.
2. Disable **EasyAntiCheat** for the game; this can be done by adding the `-eac_launcher` command line option. This is needed because it blocks the game's memory from being read. The game should alert you that this has worked on start up; if it doesn't, try restarting your computer and then launching the game again.
    - See [this PCGamingWiki article](http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:Command_line_arguments) for how to go about doing this.
3. In LiveSplit, set "Game Time" as your main timing method; right-click the main window > Compare Against > Game Time. (Both real time and time without loads are stored in your splits regardless.)

## What is autosplit?

*(All autospliting is based on follower counts, except for "Walk in the Park", which is based on subtitles, so may not work if the game text is not set to English.)*
- Starting split (once you gain control of Marcus).
- Splits for all main missions, including "Walk in the Park".
- Split for buying pants at the start of the game, if enabled in settings (default is disabled).

## Versions supported

This load remover *should* work for copies bought from any storefront. Your current version is visible in the main menu and the pause menu. I advise you disable automatic updating of your game if possible, because new versions will not be supported straight away. **Autosplitting is not supported on all versions! (see notes below)**
